Hospitals and healthcare providers face challenges in monitoring financial health, patient trends, and doctor efficiency. Key issues include:

High operational costs and unoptimized revenue streams.
Inefficient patient flow, leading to longer hospital stays and higher readmission rates.
Unbalanced doctor workloads affecting consultation efficiency and patient satisfaction.
Lack of data-driven insights for hospital administrators to make strategic decisions.
This project aims to leverage Power BI to analyze financial performance, patient trends, and provider efficiency, helping hospital management improve overall healthcare operations.

**Objective:**

The objective of this project is to leverage Power BI to analyze hospital performance across three key areas: Financial Health, Patient Trends, and Provider/Doctor Efficiency. The goal is to provide data-driven insights that help hospital administrators make informed decisions to improve operational efficiency, patient care, and financial sustainability.

 **Dataset**  

The dataset used in this project consists of approximately **100,000+ records**, covering multiple aspects of **hospital performance** across financial, patient, and provider data. The data spans over **two years**, providing historical trends and enabling in-depth analysis.
